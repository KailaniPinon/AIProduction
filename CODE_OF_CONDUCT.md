# Professional Conduct

Most of the responsibilities listed below are also available on the Pre-Production course syllabus. You can access the Pre-Production  syllabus using this link: click here.

Team members are responsible for the following behaviors:

## PUNCTUALITY
### **Be present before production sessions begin.**
 _It cannot be emphasized enough that the meetings at the beginning of class are mandatory! They cannot be missed. If they are missed, you will be marked down for the day._

Tardiness is unacceptable and will be reflected in your overall grade.

Notify the team ahead of time regarding possible tardiness or absence.

## ATTENDANCE
If you miss a class, you’re responsible for talking to teammates to become caught up.

If you’re sick, please do not come to class and infect others. Notify us and rest up!

If you miss a day and are capable of calling in over Discord, notify Thea and she will be sure to have a Discord call up on her laptop.

## DEADLINES 
### **Meet deadlines to the best of your abilities. Late work is not acceptable.**

Every component holds importance in the project, thus strive to complete deliverables in a timely manner.

## RESPONSIBILITY & ACCOUNTABILITY
Manage your time wisely.

Ask questions when necessary.

_Let your Team Leads know if you are falling behind or know you will have a packed week!!!_

_**Back up your work.**_

You are responsible for the things you have control over. Do not focus on outside distractions. As they say, ‘check drama and unrelated distractions at the door’. Your teammates are relying on you to stay focused.

## PROACTIVE LEARNING
Utilize all available resources (ex: Google, online tutorials, the library, each other, etc)

Help peers as necessary in a healthy learning space. 

Be encouraging to your team members. Everyone benefits from a supportive environment.

## COMMUNICATION
### **You will be expected to communicate weekly outside of class with your team lead, as well as the standard weekly in-class check-ins with the large group.**
_If you do not check in with your team lead outside of class once per week, or if you miss any of the weekly in-class check-ins, you will be marked down._

Attempt to be transparent about the state of your deliverables (or other project matters) throughout the project’s development.

Use the established communication channels to effectively discuss the project.

Be honest, direct, constructive, calm, respectful, and professional.

Avoid being disrespectful, sarcastic, condescending, aggressive, or personal attacks.

Avoid drama, but resolve harmful incidents if they occur. Preferably resolve them in class.

## PARTICIPATION & SEATING ARRANGEMENT
Participate during in-class discussions as much as you can.

### **Don’t self-isolate or wander around the halls.**
### _you will be marked down on your weekly participation if you do_

Be present and focused.

Work within the designated seating arrangement in order to improve production efforts and make communication easier for the team. (Illustrated Below)

## CONTENT OWNERSHIP
Content and ideas discussed in class as part of the production, are owned by the class as a whole and ultimately the media department and end client. 

No one person may claim sole ownership over ideas and content and/or prohibit the class from its use.

If you have any ideas that you think you might be too personally connected to you that you are unwilling to see altered in any way, you may want to save those for personal projects. Otherwise, share away!

Don’t be afraid to put yourself out there and be open minded…many of the best productions have come from ideas that morphed into something completely different than the original pitch, as a result of creative brainstorming and diverse influences. Collaboration also makes for more well-rounded portfolio pieces.

## RECEPTIVENESS TO FEEDBACK & CRITIQUE
You’ll be expected to take notes during moments of critique.

Do no disparage your own work.

Excuses will not be tolerated.

Ask questions. Don’t assume.

## FEEDBACK & CONTENT DECISION MAKING
All decisions regarding content direction, storyline and/or asset adjustments will be made each week at the beginning of class during group check-ins via team vote. 

In the event of a tie, the instructor will act as the ‘tie-breaker’. Once votes are complete, they are considered final unless at least 70% of the class feels it should be put up to a re-vote at a later time.

While producing a product for an end client, all revisions and final decision making regarding the project are driven by them. We can and will make suggestions, however they have the right to make the final call on any component of the project.

## PROFESSIONAL CONDUCT:
I will be factoring professional conduct into your overall grade. You are expected to conduct yourselves in a way the mimics a professional environment. This includes all of the bullet points above. 

As a rule of thumb - if you wouldn’t do something on a job, you shouldn’t do it in the classroom. This includes conduct toward other classmates and instructors alike.

Networking: In each of your courses you are networking whether you realize it or not. Your instructors and classmates could become future coworkers. They could be instrumental in job recommendations.

If you are not submitting homework, coming in late, not showing up to class, being unreceptive to feedback, disrupting class, digging your feet in and being unwilling to compromise or generally acting in an uncoachable manner… those things are registered consciously and subconsciously by those in the room with you. The other side of that is equally true. People recognize those willing to help others, being receptive to feedback, openness to collaboration, flexibility, effort, commitment to finding success and self reflection (rather than deflection) in moments of failure. I want to encourage you all to fall into the latter of these categories.

## COME TO CLASS PREPARED
bring course-related materials (notes, external drives, projects, assignments)

## HAVE FUN
This is the best one! You are going into a really cool field!! This is as close to the real thing as you can get in a school environment. 

Get excited about the materials you create! Try to come out of this course with portfolio material!
