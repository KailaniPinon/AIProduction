all doors share the same uv set, so apply the doorMAIN to every door in here.

all doors should have the handles move, but the locks wont move.

UPDATE

doorMirror added for bedroom closet

updated textures slightly, not important if it makes it or not. just toned down normals

in engine, take the AO down to 50% ish, and that solved the ugly AO problem. no idea why
its like that

Also, we need to talk about which doors go where, so far, theyre all screwed up. We'll talk
in class
