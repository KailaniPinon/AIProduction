linen bags have 4 stages to swap between. empty > small > large > full.

They share albedo and metal/smoothness maps.
Have unique normal and ao maps.

Included everything in linenBagsPkg. Never used pkgs before, so correct me if it doesnt
work. Has all 4 models, and 4 materials using a custom cull off shader. no prefabs.

NEED to use the double sided shader, included it twice. In the linenBagsPkg and its own pkg (this one is for other artists to test, not really needed for programmers)
