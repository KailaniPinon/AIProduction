those are 4k maps, theyre supposed to be big. couldnt get the detail on 2k's.

sofa and loveseat have different textures despite looking similar.

couch MAT on the base, cushion MAT on the pillows/cushions.

all pillows and cushions can move, and everything shares the same pivot, so rotating a pillow might be difficult.
if you want me to center the pivot to the pillow/cushion let me know.
