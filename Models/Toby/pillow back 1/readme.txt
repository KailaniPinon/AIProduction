this is the interior pillow for the back pillow. Is NOT displayed along with the pillowcase.
The pillowcase is a standalone asset. This is the asset for applying the pillowcase too, 
and then will be replaced.

This is designed for the left side of the bed. (Looking at the headboard, standing at the
foot of the bed). Scale inversely to get the right side version.
