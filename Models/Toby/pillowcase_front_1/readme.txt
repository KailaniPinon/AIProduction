this is the pillowcase for the front pillow. This is the model that is displayed on the bed,
the 'result' of putting the flat pillowcase on the pillow model.

This is designed for the left side of the bed. (Looking at the headboard, standing at the
foot of the bed). Scale inversely to get the right side version.
