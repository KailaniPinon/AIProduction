washcloth models. some might require the cull off shader found in models>toby>linenbags_1.

some might be fine with standard shader. Lost track of which ones need it. should be easy to
spot, but ill check in class to make sure.

the hanging cloth should have pivot set properly to fit with the new hanging large towel
and towel bar. if not, it just sits on the front, decoratively.
