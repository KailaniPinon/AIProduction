these are for the trashcans found in the bathroom and i believe kitchen. use domino's trashcan
model. the models labeled for the 'bin' have their pivot set to line up with the trash can.

all of these need the cull off shader found in the linen bags folder, models>Toby>linenBags_1

the bin model has a pulled up version, im assuming as a state change for some reason

also included are a half full and full tied bag. Intended for combining two half full bags
from the kitchen and bathroom together to create the super full bag.
