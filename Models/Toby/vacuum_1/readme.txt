one texture set for bag and grip, one for everything else.

Handle and base both pivot from the same point. Looks like it needs to pull the handle back for the brush to spin (IRL).
Will ask about cord later, for now a placeholder.
Brush and wheels rotate, small wheels dont.
Power button on grip can flip on/off.
