VR&R Game Production Team

### Introduction
Welcome to our GitHub repository! This is where we've agreed to store our various assets for the Tidy Trainers housekeeping simulation.

When you get a chance, review the [★Tidy Trainers Game Design Document★.docx](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1JfH-lJwL_DV4JUY7JDna6ZUCbfMSl24Pqtl_IIkbNKo "Link to game design document - Click to open!")

This document contains the core project design features, production expecations, and additional team information. This file is the go-to document for basic questions you may have concerning the project. 

Note, this document will evolve and continuously be updated throughout the project's development lifetime, but it will ultimately reflect the concepts agreed upon during class sessions.

### General Communication
Looking to get a hold of a team member? While our primary communication tool is Discord, be aware that e-mail and Trello are also available! If you have any comments, questions, or concerns, don't be afraid to reach out to the team. Just please be mindful of who you intend to contact and the manner in which you discuss matters. Be kind and considerate!

`note: Names with diamonds (♦) indicate team members associated with leadership roles. If you're feeling lost or need direction, don't hesitate to reach out to these members. They'll assist you to the best of their ability!`

# Programming

VR&R Game Production Team

Lead: Stephen

Second: Kailani

### About this Branch

The Programming branch is intended to store scripts, packages, and other parts and pieces of functionality. The folders contain the following content:

>Programming Assets

These contain completed assets that are intended to be incorporated into the simulation. Content varies, but ultimately these assets are related to Unity functionality. These include, but aren't limited to:

* input behaviors
* responses and effects
* editor (inspector) development

**NEW 7/1/2018** After carefully considering the workflow during Game Pre-Production, individual files are now active in order to improve our team production efforts. Individual files are meant to improve 2 primary areas:

1. Focus

It's easy to get lost with all the resources and assets bouncing around throughout development. This hopefully gives team members a definite space for themselves within the repository.

2. Accountability

This is meant to provide a more evident visual for contributions made in this particular branch. It's intended to help peers gauge their output and adjust as necessary, whether that means picking up the slack or slowing down and delegating assignments.

**ONLY UPLOAD UNITY-READY ASSETS (scripts, packages, etc)**

### Sunday Check-ins

Discord chats have been scheduled Sunday evenings between **7:30pm and 8:30pm**. Times may vary from week to week, but on average, meetings are generally an hour long. 

These chats are primarily intended for the programming team, but all VR&R members are welcomed to join, respond, and/or simply watch/listen. Request your friendly neighborhood programmers for a chat invite and we'll patch you in.

(For programmers) It's recommended to be ready with the following:

* progress discussions
* development visuals
* updated GitHub files
* comments, questions, or concerns regarding project

### Naming Conventions

Clean, consistent naming conventions decreases time spent searching for assets and saves both valueable time and energy for the team as a whole. Help us out by following the approved conventions below:

>Namespace

utilize the namespace WestgateVRTS in all your scripts

example: namespace WestgateVRTS { //your class behavior }

>Script (Class)

Identifier_Type    

examples: "User_Controls", "Dishes_Wash"

`note: scripts will have corresponding master scripts  
("User_Master", "Dishes_Master")`

>Variables

utilize Camel Case

examples: “userSpeed", "someSortOfVariableUsedToDoSomething"

`note: Variables names must be clearly and coherently communicate its intention. 
Shorthand for things that you may only know are not to be used.`

>Functions & Methods

utilize Pascal Case  

examples: "Jump", "AFunctionOrMethodThatDoesSomething"

`note: Functions and methods should be named so they are clearly understood by any other group members if they are to read your code.

note: Place functions & methods in an order that is easily understood by someone walking through your scripts.

note: Don't be afraid to give your functions/methods lengthy name if that’s what it takes to understand what’s going on`

>Unity Packages

PrimaryIdentifier_name

examples: "PFX_confetti.unitypackage", "UX_collisionActivity.unitypackage", "SFX_audioProximity.unitypackage"
